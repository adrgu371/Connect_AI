README.mdI created with the help of AI (Grok 3, DeepSeek and Copilot) a python script to connect any model run locally in Ollama to the internet. We used Brave Search API and OpenWeatherMap API. In addition, the script automatically saves the discussions in a json file to have fluency in the discussions. I build it with qwen2.5:7b-instruct-q4_K_M because I only have 8Gb of ram, you can choose which model you want depending on the available ram. I created the script from Ubuntu, it also runs on MacBook Air M3. I haven't tested it on Windows. To run it you need Ollama, Python3, the desired model and the following dependencies: pip install aiohttp requests beautifulsoup4 cachetools langchain langchain_ollama ollama importlib-metadata python-dotenv  To run, you also need an API from Brave Search (it's free for 2000 searches/month) and API for OpenWeatherMap (it's free for 1000 searches
